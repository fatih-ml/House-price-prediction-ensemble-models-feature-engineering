Kaggle Competition: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

1. Introduction
Briefly explain the competition and its objective.
Provide an overview of the dataset.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Load the dataset.
Explore the data:
    Check for missing values.
    Analyze the features (categorical, numerical, etc.).
    Visualize distributions and correlations.
Data preprocessing:
    Handle missing values (imputation).
    Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
    Scale or normalize numerical features if needed.

3. Feature Engineering
Create new features if necessary based on domain knowledge.
Engineer features that may be important for predicting house prices.

4. Data Splitting
Split the data into training and validation sets.

5. Model Selection and Training
Choose regression models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
Train the models on the training data.

6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared, etc.).
Compare the performance of different models.

7. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)
Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

8. Final Model Training and Predictions
Train the chosen model(s) on the entire dataset.
Make predictions on the test set.

9. Submission
Format the predictions according to Kaggle's submission requirements.
Submit the results to Kaggle.
